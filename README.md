# ip_location

Get an IP location from the command line.

1. Make the Script Executable: Use the chmod command to make the script executable.

  `chmod +x iplocation`

3. Move the Script to a Directory in your PATH: If you want to call the script from anywhere in the terminal, you should move it to a directory that's included in your system's PATH. Common locations are /usr/local/bin or ~/bin (you may need to create the latter and add it to your PATH).

  `mv iplocation.sh /usr/local/bin/iplocation`
